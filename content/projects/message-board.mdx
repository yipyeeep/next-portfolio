## 📌 Overview  

A modern message board built with:  
✔ **React + TypeScript** (strict typing)  
✔ **Supabase** (Auth + PostgreSQL)  
✔ **Row-Level Security** (RLS) for data safety  

Developed as a **full-stack learning project** between **May 5-20, 2025**

## ✨ Features  

- **Realtime Messages**  
  Fetch and display posts with Supabase subscriptions  
- **Secure Auth**  
  Google/GitHub login + custom React hook for session management  
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**  
  PostgreSQL RLS policies control CRUD operations  
- **End-to-End Testing**  
  Playwright tests for critical user flows  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **React 18**: A JavaScript library for building interactive UIs with hooks.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for scalable frontend code.
- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative with PostgreSQL and Auth.
- **PostgreSQL RLS**: Row-level security for granular database permissions.
- **React Router v6**: Client-side routing for single-page applications.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for reliable user flows.
- **Netlify**: Cloud platform for deploying static and serverless sites.
- **Docker**: Containerization for local Supabase development.

   ```sh
   supabase init  
   supabase start  
   ```

2. **Run Frontend**:  
   ```sh
   npm install  
   npm run dev  
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:  
   ```sh

## 📚 Development Notes  

**Why Supabase?**  
- Replaced Firebase with open-source alternative  
- PostgreSQL’s RLS enabled secure direct DB access  
- Built-in Auth saved 100+ lines of custom code  

**Key Learnings**:  
✔ Writing RLS policies for multi-tenant data  
✔ Creating custom React hooks for Supabase Auth  
✔ Testing authenticated flows with Playwright  

## Conclusion  

This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable, secure** full-stack app with:  
- **Minimal boilerplate** (leveraging Supabase’s APIs)  
- **Type safety** across frontend and database  
- **Production-ready practices** (E2E tests, RLS)
